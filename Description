The goal of this assignment was to model a credit-risky portfolio of corporate bonds. Corporate bonds offer a higher yield than some other investments (like equities), but for a price. Most corporate bonds are debentures, meaning they are not secured by collateral. Investors in such bonds must assume not only interest rate risk but also credit risk. Credit Risk is the risk of monetary loss due to the default, or a change in the perceived likelihood of default, of a counterparty to a contract. Corporate bonds tend to offer higher yields compared to other investments to compensate the bond investor for the credit risk. Corporations that issue high yield bonds can be small companies or even large companies that are experiencing a degree of financial distress. As high yield bonds are generally more risky than investment-grade bonds, investors expect to earn a higher yield to compensate them for that risk. However it is important to assess credit risk before investing in corporate bonds as the risk of default is high compared to government bonds.
